# python-sample-questions
This repo contains solutions to various daily coding problems from places such as leetcode, dailyocdingproblem, hackerrank, and coding wars. 
The problems will be of varying difficulty level. If you have any suggestions on how to improve either the time or space complexity of any
algorithms, please let me know. I am always looking to improve as a Python developer and as a developer overall.

Files will be numbered sequentially. My first attempt at solving a problem will be labeled with 1, the 2nd with a 2, and so on. For example, 
file1.py will be my first solution, file2.py will be my second solution. Typically the first solution will be trying to solve the problem in
a "non-pythonic", brute force way. Revisions will focus on improving either time or space complexity and making the solution more pythonic.
